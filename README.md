just some files

the model for the mold is outdated, the most recent one i used had air pockets in the long part's base but i think i deleted it or something because free version of fusion only allowed me to have 10 files at a time

the sketch on one face of the machine is just for a built-in display that i might implement some day if i recontinue this
